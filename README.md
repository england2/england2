I architect synergistic code-adjacent outcomes by orchestrating polyglot abstractions across the full-stack continuum, leveraging AI-native vibes, latency-aware paradigms, and opinionated uncertainty. My workflow converges declarative intent with imperative chaos, shipping cloud-shaped artifacts that scale horizontally in spirit if not in practice. I specialize in refactoring problems into frameworks, frameworks into platforms, and platforms into README-driven development. Fluent in distributed monoliths, eventual consistency of thought, and the careful misuse of benchmarks, I optimize for impact per keystroke while maintaining a robust pipeline of buzzwords. Currently exploring the liminal space between automation and accountability, where models hallucinate features and features hallucinate roadmaps.
